These girls come in all shapes and sizes, like women in any part of the world.

But, Filipino women are perfectly aware of the effect they have on men (especially foreign men looking for a Filipino wife) and the girls love making this effect even stronger, with the help of sexy clothes and makeup.

They are racially similar to Malays but more Spanish culturally. An exquisite blend of beauty and character traits.

Beauty products such as Papaya Soap and other skin whitening creams continue to rocket in sales numbers.

### Filipino Women Love Children

Filipinas are borne mothers.

They all desperately desire to have, and raise cute children.

Since foreign travel is so abundant, many filipino girls readily see the potential with mating and raising kids with foreigners. Cute blue-eyes filipino children is an area where younger Pinay girls are heading.

This natural mothering instinct gives these women a warm and inviting charisma any foreigner will find irresistible.

## Do Filipino Women Make Good Wives?

Unlike my friends who live permanently in the Philippines, I'm not looking for a wife. I'm perfectly content with changing Filipina girlfriends on a regular basis. I'm still in 'Try Before You Buy' mode.

But here's what my friends constantly tell me about why the love being married to their special Philippines woman:-

### Filipinas Want to Make Their Man Happy, Always

Filipinas value their relationships. You don't have to worry that you get married and then 'boom!', she doesn't care about you anymore.

Harmony and a fulfilling relationship are very important to her.

She will do everything in her power to make you happy and to make sure that the relationship with you is fulfilling.

And make sure you contribute your part, to the relationship too!

### They Accept The Man's Leading Position

A Filipino woman will not compete with you for the leadership in the family.

She fully understands that men are often better suited for providing for the household, and making important life decisions, and they are ready to give them the reins.

They will always be there for you.

### She Treats You with Respect & Loyalty

The Philippines is a country that teaches children to respect teachers and elders and women to respect men.

If you marry a Filipina she will respect her man as long as he respects her.

There is absolutely nothing you have to worry about when it comes to her respecting you.

If you give your Filipina wife the love and respect she deserves, she will always be your loyal partner.

She's family-oriented, she is respectful, and she does everything in her power to make you happy and to turn your relationship into an adventure.

What are you waiting for?

'_Go marry a Filipina_', say all my friends here lol

### A Filipina's Sexuality

Like other foreigners, you'll discover just how easy it is to bang your way around the Philippines, with one or more cute and sexy Filipino girls.

**They love sex and travelling, so that combination is made for foreigners travelling for a short or long time in a beautiful country. Did I mention that they love sex? They really do!**

Filipina women are a cultural mix of Asian, and Spanish heritage. Historic Latin American culture then strongly influences _their high sexual appetite and libido_.

But you'll find that Filipinas step that ranking up a notch or two. They've got the cultural Latino libidos combined with the easy-going islander mentality to 'live for the moment'.

Young Pinay girls see the old fashioned taboo of virginity as an obstacle of them entering a more satisfying and fulfilling sex life. They are also under peer pressure to lose their virginity, none.

Engaging in sex (with a mature knowledgeable foreigner) is highly desirable as they believe they can be cared for, in case of impregnation. And it's a status symbol too.

## So How Do You Date a Filipino Girl?

- Be persistent when needed. Filipino girls are demure and like to play coy even when they see an obvious interest from a man.
- Take her on nice dates. Filipino women are not demanding, especially [in a new relationship](https://pinayromances.com/blog/successful-online-filipina-dating-from-start-to-finish)

Don't worry about where they live either. It could be [Manila](https://pinayromances.com/blog/filipina-dating-better-things-to-do-with-your-girl-in-manila), [Cebu](https://pinayromances.com/blog/are-cebu-girls-different-to-manila-women) or anywhere else in between. Work on those logistics later.
